# Shanon-Fano-Algorithm-In-C++
An entropy encoding technique for lossless data compression of Multimedia.

Data Compression, also known as source coding, is the process of
encoding or converting data in such a way that it consumes less memory
space. Data compression reduces the number of resources required to
store and transmit data.
<br>
● They are effectively used to detect and correct errors.<br>
● For Shannon Fano coding procedure we do not need to build the entire
codebook instead, we simply obtain the code for the tag corresponding to
a given sequence. It is entirely feasible to code sequences of length 20 or
more.
<br>
Application :<br>
● They are used in computer memory, modems and embedded processors.<br>
● They are used in Nano Satellites.
